SAS Code
========

This is my personal repo for SAS macros and codes. I have written hundred thousands lines code in SAS over the last 12 years - some of them are completely useless due to changes in SAS version (new procs of functions added to make SAS programmers life easier), others are split on multiple versions with small changes (git was particularly popular a few years back).

So I have decided to put an end to the mess I have created over the years by saving code in multiple folders & projects.

I've split the repo in:

* macros: contains macros I have found useful over the years. Some macros are simple utilities and some others are for analytics purposes.
* code: any code that is worthless to convert to a macro but useful as a reminder of how do things.

I'll be adding code as soon as I have the time to refactor it.
